<p>A look at the graph gives us the following information.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>The answer cannot be \(\( y=5+x^2 \)\) since this graph has a maximum at \((0,5)\) and \(\( y=5+x^2 \)\) has no maximum as \(x\) increases.</p></li>
<li><p>The answer cannot be \(\( y=x^2-5 \)\) for two reasons.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First, when \(x=0\) we get \(\( y=x^2-5 \)=-5\) and we know from the graph than when \(x=0, y=5\)</p>
<p>Second, this graph has a maximum at \((0,5)\) and \(\( y=x^2-5 \)\) has no maximum as \(x\) increases.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman"><li><p>The answer cannot be \(\( y=-x^2 \)\) since when \(x=0, \( y=-x^2 \)=0\) and we know from the graph that when \(x=0, y=5\)</p></li></ol>
<p>To make sure we might want to check the remaining answer, \(\( y=5-x^2 \)\text{.}\)  It has the correct maximum at \((0,5\) and the graph looks like a parabola.  If we were certain that the points at which the function corsses the \(x\)-axis were \((-\sqrt{5},0)\) and \((\sqrt{5},0)\) then we could be more sure, since just as the equation of a line can be found from knowing two points, the equation of a parabola can be found from knowing three points.</p>
