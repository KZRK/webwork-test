<p>The solution set is \(\left\{(x,y): y \lt \frac{x+1}{x-5}\right\}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The domain of \(f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x-5}\) is the set of all real numbers except 5.</p>
<p>By plotting a few well-chosen points and being careful what happens as \(x\) gets large, small, or near the vertical line \(x = 5\text{,}\) we arrive a sketch like the one shown below.  The graph is drawn with a dashed line because no points on the graph belong to the solution set.</p>
<p>The vertical line \(x = 5\) is included in the picture because it is involved in partitioning the plane into regions.  It is drawn as a dashed line because \(\frac{x+1}{x-5}\) is undefined at \(x=5\text{,}\) hence \(x = 5\) can not belong to the solution set.</p>

<p>The plane is now partitioned into 4 regions: above and below each curve, and on each side of the line \(x = 5\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For the region below the leftmost curve we choose \((-3, 0)\) as the test point.  Since \(0 \lt \frac{-2}{-8}\text{,}\) all points in this region belong to the solution set.</p>
<p>For the region above the leftmost curve and left of the line \(x = 5\text{,}\) we choose \((0, 0)\) as the test point.  Since \(0 &gt; \frac{1}{-5}\text{,}\) no points in this region belong to the solution set.</p>
<p>For the region below the rightmost curve and right of the line \(x = 5\text{,}\) we choose \((6, 0)\) as the test point.  Since \(0 \lt \frac{7}{1}\text{,}\) all points in this region belong to the solution set.</p>
<p>For the region above the rightmost curve and right of the line \(x = 5\text{,}\) we choose \((8, 8)\) as the test point.  Since \(8 \lt \frac{9}{3}\text{,}\) no points in this region belong to the solution set.</p>
<p>Finally, we shade the regions for which all points belong to the solution set.</p>
