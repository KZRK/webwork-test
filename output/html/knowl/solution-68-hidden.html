<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>We could possibly observe right away that \(f(1) = f(-1) = 2\text{,}\) which means that \(f\) can not have an inverse.  If we were lucky enough to see that, then there is nothing more to do.  If we weren't, then we could proceed as above and try to solve \(y = f(x)\) for \(x\text{.}\)  Doing that leads to \(x = \pm \sqrt{y-1}\text{,}\) which tells us there may be two different values of \(x\) that give the same value of \(y\text{.}\)  For example, if we choose \(y = 2\text{,}\) then the equation says we must have \(x = \pm 1\text{,}\) that is, that \(f(1) = f(-1) = 2\text{.}\)</p></div></body>
