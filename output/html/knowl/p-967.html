<p>The solution to a system (or collection) of inequalities in one variable is the set of all numbers for which each inequality in the system is true. Thus, one way to find the solution to a system of inequalities is to solve each inequality, and then identify the sets of points where the solutions overlap. Another way to do it is</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>First, rewrite each expression in a form where the inequality is with respect to 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the collection of all numbers with the property that at least one expression is zero or an expression is undefined. These partition the real line into a number of intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a test point in each interval and check if every inequality in the system is true at that point. If so, then all points on the interior of the interval belong to the solution set, and if not then no points in the interior of the interval belong to the solution set.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful about what happens at the endpoints of the intervals.</p></li>
